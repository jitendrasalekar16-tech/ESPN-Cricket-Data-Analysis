🏏 Cricket Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Practical Project #3
I’m excited to share my 3rd hands-on Power BI practical project, focused on Cricket Performance Analytics.
This dashboard transforms raw cricket match data into meaningful performance insights using interactive visuals and KPI-driven analysis.
The objective of this project was to evaluate player performance trends, consistency, and impact using structured data modeling and DAX calculations.
 

🔍 Key Insights Covered:
• Player-wise Runs & Strike Rate analysis
 • Boundary Contribution % (4s & 6s impact)
 • Match-wise performance trends
 • Batting Average & Consistency tracking
 • Comparative analysis across players
 

📊 Tools & Skills Applied:
• Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query
 • DAX Measures for Strike Rate, Batting Average & Boundary %
 • KPI Cards & Dynamic Slicers
 • Data Modeling & Relationship Building
 • Interactive Dashboard Design
 

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of how performance metrics — whether in sports or business — help in strategic decision-making and evaluation.
Each practical project is helping me improve my analytical thinking and dashboard development skills step by step.
